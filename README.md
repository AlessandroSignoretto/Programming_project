# Programming_project
'''**Airbnb** serves as an internet platform that facilitates the organization and provision of accommodations, predominantly homestays, as well 
as tourism-oriented experiences since its establishment in 2008.
New York City, the most densely populated metropolis in the United States, also ranks among the globe's foremost destinations for both tourism and business endeavors.'''

'''In this project, I analyse an extensive database about variables related to Airbnb listings in the city of New York. 
The primary objective is to develop a predictive model for estimating the nightly prices of these accommodations. The project unfolds in several distinct stages:
- Firstly, an in-depth analysis of the database is conducted. This includes data cleansing procedures, involving the removal of not relevant columns and the completing of missing data points.
- Secondly, the exploration extends to the construction of insightful visualizations. Graphical representations are made to examine the behavior of different variables and assess their correlations with the target price column.
- Lastly, the dataset is split into both training and test sets. These subsets serve for the creation and assessment of regression models. 
Through these models, the aim is to derive predictive insights that contribute to the accurate estimation of the prices.'''

 '''These are the variables it contains:
- id: - id number that identifies the property
- name: - Property name
- host_id: - id number that identifies the host
- host_name: - Host name
- neighbourhood_group: - The main regions of the city
- neighbourhood: - The neighbourhoods
- latitude: - Property latitude
- longitude: - Property longitude
- room_type: - Type of the room
- price: - The price for one night
 - minimum_nights: - Minimum amount of nights to book the place
- number_of_reviews: - Number of reviews received
- last_review: - Date of the last review
- reviews_per_month: - Amount of reviews per month
- calculated_host_listings_count: - Number of properties available on Airbnb owned by the host
- availability_365: - Number of days of availability within 365 days'''
